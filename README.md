 ## Description
This Repository contains code for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp's Challenge 20 "React Challenge: React Portfolio". 

For this this week's challenge, we were tasked to create a portfolio using React to showcase the projects we've done in the bootcamp to date.

The application will be using the React Javascript Library and will be deployed with Github Pages.
